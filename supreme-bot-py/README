To run this the first thing you'll need is python. You can download that from here https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/
Get the latest Python 3 release. After this, open a command prompt and type 'python --version' without the quotes, then hit enter. 
It should list the version of python you're on.

Download an editor to view the code in, I recommend VSCode which you can get here https://code.visualstudio.com/download

Next we need to install our dependencies. We'll use pip3 to do that.
Open up VSCode and open up the directory of the project, supreme-bot-py.
Once you have the directory open, click the terminal tab at the bottom.
In the terminal, type 'pip3 install selenium'

And that should hopefully be enough. Now you can right click in editor and go to 'Run python file in terminal' and it should all work.
