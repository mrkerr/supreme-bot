FOR THE BOT TO KNOW YOUR INFO YOU NEED TO CREATE THE CONSTANTS

1) IN THIS DIRECTORY, CREATE A NEW FOLDER CALLED 'constants'
2) IN THAT DIRECTORY, CREATE A FILE CALLED 'constants.py'
3) OPEN UP constants.py
4) COPY EVERYTHING BETWEEN THE TICKS INTO THE FILE

```
class PersonalConstants():
  NAME = 'Your Name'
  EMAIL = 'email@gmail.com'
  TEL = '123-456-789'
  ADDR = '123 Main St'
  APT = ''
  ZIP = '12345'
  CITY = 'Springfield'
  STATE = 'IL'


class CardConstants():
  NUM = '1234-1234-1234-1234'
  MON = '05'
  YER = '2020'
  CEV = '123'


class ItemsToBuy():
  items = [
    'Supreme®/Barbour® Waxed Cotton Camp Cap',
    'Overdyed Hooded Sweatshirt',
    'Hourglass Raglan L/S Top'
  ]
  items_categories = [
    'sweatshirts', 
    'hats',
    'tops'
  ]

class DropInfo():
  URL = 'https://www.supremenewyork.com/shop/new'
  DROP_TIME = "09:59:58"
  TEST_MODE = False
```

THAT'S IT YOU'RE ALL SET. FOR HELP WITH ADDING YOUR OWN INFO TO THIS FILE
