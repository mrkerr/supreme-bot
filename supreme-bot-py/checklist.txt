All the editing for a drop can be done in constants/constants.py

Set the drop time to a few seconds before the actual time (use local military time)
Once the time you specify hits, the bot will start refreshing every 0.5 seconds

Make sure TEST_MODE is set to False, with no quotes, before a drop or it won't run

Make sure you use single quotes for everything

To add more items, put a comma after all except the last item. For example:
  items = [
    'Supreme®/Barbour® Waxed Cotton Camp Cap',
    'Overdyed Hooded Sweatshirt',
    'Debossed Ashtray'
  ]

Same idea with items categories, put all the categories for the items you're targetting.
(so if you wanted a hat and a hoodie, the categories would be 'hats' and 'sweatshirts')

Make sure all the personal and card info is fiilled out as well, and make sure to leave the hyphens in

For size targets, put the sizes in the order you want the bot to attempt to select
So if you want it to try small first, then large, the medium, it should look like:
  sizes = [
    'small', 
    'large', 
    'medium'
  ]  
BE SURE THAT THERE ARE ALWAYS THREE SIZES SPECIFIED
(if you don't specify three target sizes it will break)

Make sure to use capital letters for item names and sizes
